*Increasing complexity (mobility, system connectivity) causes increasing difficulty in managing risk and security and demonstrating compliance*


>**Current State**:
Standards -> Policies -> Procedures and Guidelines -> Repeat

Security by Design provides security control built in throughout the AWS IT management process
 - IAM
 - Trusted Advisors
 - CloudWatch
 - Cloud HSM
 - Config Rules
 - CloudTrail
 - DirectorServices
 - ?

### Design Principles

- Build security in every layer
- Design for failures
- Implement auto-healing
- Think parallel
- Plan for a breach
- Don't fear constraints
- Leverage different storage options
- Design for Cost
- *Treat infrastructure as code* (Major takeaway)

#### Ecosystem

- Security by Design
- AWS Cofig Rules
- AWS CloudFormation
- Amazon Inspector
- [CloudCheckr](cloudcheckr.com)

#### Modernize Technology Governance

1. Decide what to do (Strategy)
 - Identify Stakeholders
 - Identify Your workloads moving to AWS
2. Analyze and Document (Outside of AWS)
 - Rationalize Security Requirements
 - Define Data Protections and Controls
 - Document Security Architecture
3. Automate, Deploy & Monitor
 - Build/deploy Security Architecture
 - Automate Security Operations
 - Continuous Monitor
 - Testing and Game Days
4. Certify
 - Audit and Certification
